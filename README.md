# Gitmoji Commit

Stop wasting time looking up git commit message emojis. This extension helps you find the right emoji and helps write your commit message, all without leaving VS Code.

## Usage

When the time comes to type your commit message:

1. `Ctl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac) to open command prompt
2. Locate `Gitmoji Commit` command and select
3. Type to filter selections
4. Select desired commit type via `Click` or `Enter`
5. Type the text of your commit into the input
6. Press `Enter`
7. Proceed with life

- intended for use with the integrated terminal

## Future Plans

I have been debating between generating the text of the commit (_the original version_) vs providing an input where the user types there own text (_the current version_). One solution is to offer a toggle in settings. I decided to change to the input because I found myself changing the app supplied text on almost every commit. I made the app because I could rememeber the emojis, their codes, and what they were for. I am open to feedback on how to approach this issue.
